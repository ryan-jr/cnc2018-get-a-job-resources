# PRE-MISSION

## Your first assignment is heeeeeeeerrrree!!!

**PRE-MISSION:** Complete an honest, self-evaluation.

**GOAL:** Understand where you are, where you want to go, and what you might work on to prepare for your job search.

**HOMEWORK:**:

1. **Get something to write on.** Throughout the challenge, I'll ask you to jot down notes, answer questions, and reflect. So start a Google Doc, grab a notebook, or open up your favorite text editor, and write "Get A Job" at the top. This doc is for you, but if at any point you'd like to share it with me for feedback or questions, put it in a Google Doc and send me the link. I'd be happy to take a look.

2. **Where are your skills currently?** Evaluating your skills, especially when you're in the process of getting your first coding job, can be tough. Let's start by having you jot down answers to the following questions: What languages and frameworks do you know? Of the languages and frameworks you know, which do you know best? Put them in order of proficiency. *Bonus:* Find a developer (or 2!) to look over some of your code and give you some feedback on how job-ready you are.

3. **What coding projects do you have?** Having coding projects to talk about and showcase are an important part of the job search process. It's also what we'll use to create (or improve) your portfolio. Make a list of the projects you've completed. Depending on what your skills are, these might be deployed apps, toy projects, repos, or something else. Order that list by how well you think it demonstrates your abilities (and potential!) to a future employer.

4. **What are your knowledge gaps?** There is so much code to learn! You won't know everything, but there are probably a few things you know you should know. What are some knowledge gaps that you'd like to fill? Write a list of topics you'd like to learn next, prioritizing ones that you think would help you in your job search. *Bonus:* Find a developer or two and ask what their knowledge gaps were during their first job search, and how they filled them.

5. **What are your ideal job titles?** Now we get to real job stuff. What are a few job titles that you're interested in? Based on your answers to questions 1-4, what are job titles you think you'd have a good shot at applying for? Do some research and write down 3 that you might focus your search on. Next, search those titles and look at a few job descriptions. What are some things you might want to learn or skills you want to brush up on to make yourself a good applicant for the jobs you found? Write those down.

6. **Share your findings in our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cnc2018/) by Jan 19. (Password: New Year, New Moves)** Share the projects you're proud of and what you learned in your job title research with us. If you're not on Facebook, tweet us with the *#CNC2018* hashtag.
